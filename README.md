Notes

 Note:  Whenever the state variable changes the react will re-render the component
 We can use the state variable to store the data that we want to display on the UI 
 React will keep the data sync with UI layer
 
UseEffect: Call back function will be called after rendering the intial rendering the component
Shimmer UI: 

conditional rendering
if(listOfResturent.length===0){
    return <div>Loading...</div>
}

why use useState()?
